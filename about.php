						<p>Established January 2018
							Our mission is to equip student athletes with the tools to be successful in life not just as athletes, but students as well.</p>
						<p>We are in need of donations to assist our fundraising efforts. Although we have reduced the funds required tremendously, some players have still found difficulty with paying themselves and finding donors. We are reaching out for donations that will aid our young men to become proactive with their attempts to earn money in a productive way. For example, candy donations for fundraising, coupon gift cards i.e. pizza discount cards and so on. To make a donation, please email us via contact page.
